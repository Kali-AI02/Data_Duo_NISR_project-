# NISR 2025 Big Data Hackathon ‚Äì Track 1: Data for Export Growth  

## üìå Introduction  
This project was developed as part of the **NISR 2025 Big Data Hackathon**. The hackathon engages university students in designing innovative data-driven solutions for Rwanda‚Äôs national development challenges.  

We chose **Track 1: Data for Export Growth**, where the challenge is to **identify Rwanda‚Äôs next big export opportunity** by analyzing global trade data, predicting demand, and generating actionable insights for policy and business.

## üéØ Objectives  
- Promote youth-driven data science solutions for national development.  
- Identify potential high-growth export products for Rwanda.  
- Use **machine learning** to predict global demand trends.  
- Develop a **dashboard / mobile alerts system** for visualization.  
- Provide **policy recommendations** for supporting Rwanda‚Äôs export strategy.  
- Encourage **SME and youth engagement** in export sectors.

## üõ†Ô∏è Methodology  
1. **Data Collection**  
   - Sources:  NISR datasets.  
2. **Data Preprocessing & Cleaning**  
   - Handling missing values, harmonizing trade codes and formatting.  
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Export/import trends, sector performance, country demand analysis.  
4. **Machine Learning Models**  
   - Time series forecasting (ARIMA, Prophet, LSTM).  
   - Regression models to predict demand.  
5. **Visualization & Tools**  
   - Dash/Plotly or Streamlit.  
   - Mobile-friendly notifications or alert system.  
6. **Insights & Recommendations**  
   - Identify sectors with strong growth potential.  
   - Policy suggestions for government and private stakeholders.
